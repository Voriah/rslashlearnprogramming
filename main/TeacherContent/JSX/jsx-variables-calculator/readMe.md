#Instructions

You are going to be building a calculator that takes in two variables and does math on each of them

* Create a new Express Application (Make sure to add in all necessary middleware and view engines)

* You will need one component : a main entry point for the calculator (`index.jsx`)
 
* Create a variable `a` and a variable `b`

* Create 5 JSX <li> and inside each do inline math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus)
