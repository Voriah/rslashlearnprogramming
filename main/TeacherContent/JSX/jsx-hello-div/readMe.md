# Hello Div
## Instructions

* Using the code from the `jsx-hello-world` activity as a starting point, update the page so that it returns the following JSX:

  * A heading tag introducing yourself, e.g., `<h1>Hello! My name is <insert name here></h1>`.

  * An unordered list containing at least 3 things you like (these can be anything).

### Hints

* You will need to import the React library.

* Reference the previous `jsx-hello-world` activity if you get stuck with any syntax.

* If you're trying to render multiple JSX tags from a single component, you should enclose all of the JSX tags within a single parent tag, such as a `div`.
