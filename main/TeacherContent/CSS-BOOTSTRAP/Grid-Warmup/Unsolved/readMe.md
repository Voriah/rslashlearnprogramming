# Grid Warmup!

> Open up and run the `index.html` page inside of the `Solved` folder so you can see the end result you will be working towards.

> Using Bootstrap Components and Grid, create as close to a solution as possible to match the solved version. Remember, there are no wrong answers with Grid. Just be creative.
