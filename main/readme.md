### Questions Answered
> ##### What do I use this for?
Gitlab will be where you find all the resources we will be using for the class. This will include:
1. In-Class Activities and Solutions
2. Homework Instructions and Solutions
3. Supplemental Videos and Activities
4. Instructor Created Materials and Resources

> ##### How come I do not see all the resources there right now?
It is important that we follow a specific curriculum order and pacing. These topics are complex and need your time and focus, so we will only be posting the next week's curriculum the __saturday__ before it's begun.

> ##### How do I best utilize this tool?
Make checking Gitlab a part of your regular in-class routine. When you walk into class, you should always pull down the current repository on Gitlab to make sure you have the most up-to-date resources.

### Instructor Tips

1. Pull down the Gitlab Repo at the beginning of every class. You never know if you are missing an activity.
2. If you have a break available, use it. I can't tell you the amount of times I have spent half a day working on a problem, walked away for *__5 minutes__*, and come back with the solution.
3. Do not look at the solution files for any of the activities until you are absolutely certain you gave it your very best attempt. Remember, you paid for this class to get the most out of it. It won't serve you if you copy/paste the answers into your programs.
4. You have access to your Istructor and TAs 45 minutes before class and 30 minutes after. Use that time.
5. Pair Programming is an incredibly useful tactic for you to implement. Often times, you will not be coding alone. You will be on a team of people who are all working towards the same goal. And in many cases, this will involve some time of two people working from one computer. Choose a driver, the one who handles the keyboard. Choose a navigator, the one who gives direction and reviews the code as it is typed in. The one caviat is you *__must__* switch off frequently. 
6. Purchase a small, yellow rubber duck. Whenever you have a problem with your code, place the duck on your desk and explain your code line by line to the duck. This is called [Rubber Duck Debugging (Rubber Ducking)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and it is a widely accepted way to debug your code. Often you find the answer to your problem in the midst of having to explain it. That's the idea behind this practice.
