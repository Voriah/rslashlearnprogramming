# Movie JSON Dump

## File

* [`movie-json-dump`](Unsolved/movie-json-dump.html)

## Instructions

* Using `movie-json-dump.html` in `06-MovieJSONDump` as starter code, add functionality such that clicking `Movie Search` triggers an AJAX call to the OMDb database and the JSON response to be appended onto the page.

* If you finish early, begin reading about the [Bands In Town API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0). Try to understand how to search for a specific artist.
